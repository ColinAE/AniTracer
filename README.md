## Status

Protocol 1: 3D Transformations

Completed

All 3D transformations have been implemented. When user specifies protocol 1 on the command line along with the other required 
command-line arguments, a REPL will start that will allow the user to transform each model and write out a model file using
the newly-transformed model if they so please.

Protocol 2: Ray-tracing with single image as output

Work begun. Not at testing stage.

Protocol 3: Ray-tracing with moving camera and/or dynamically transformed objects.

No work started.
